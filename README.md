This a repository created for the competition code.fun.do++ conducted by Microsoft India.
Challenge: Find better ways to save lives and prevent economic losses through mechanisms to predict, prevent, or manage the impact of natural disasters.
Idea:
    Hundreds of thousands of people have lost their lives due to earthquakes in last 100 years and improvement in technology has hardly made any change. Most of the lives lost due to earthquakes are due to the mismanagement after they have happened. If after natural calamities  emergency services are managed so as to reach the worst affected areas first, a lot of lives can be saved. Our software finds the worst affected artificial structures so that releif agencies can assign higher priority to them. As soon as the earthquake is detected an artificially intelligent drone can fly over the buildings grading them according to the damage they have received and sending the data to emergency services which will help them to reach the affected buildings faster and carry out rescue operations more effectively. Drones can also be used to find missing mountaineers and hikers especially after landslides and avelanches, same goes for people stuck in a flood. Properly managing natural disasters can help us save a lot of lives.
