This a repository created for the competition code.fun.do++ conducted by Microsoft India.
Challenge: Find better ways to save lives and prevent economic losses through mechanisms to predict, prevent, or manage the impact of natural disasters.
Idea:
    Hundreds of thousands of people have lost their lives due to earthquakes in last 100 years and improvement in technology has hardly made any change. Most of the lives lost due to earthquakes are due to the mismanagement after they have happened. If emergency services after such natural calamities are managed so as to reach the worst affected areas first, a lot of lives can be saved. Our software finds the worst affected artificial structures so that releif agencies can assign higher priority to them. Proper management of natural calamities can reduce the casualties by atleast 90%.
